    Disable HTML5 Autoplay

### To Disable Ads In Chrome

Enter `chrome://flags` in the url bar and search for "Autoplay Policy" and set it to "Document user activation is required"

![Settings Image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/167818/27504657-6d0be298-585c-11e7-8209-81b272396b0b.png)

As of Sept 25, 2017 this does not affect some major news and other websites which will still autoplay even though this
is set.

### Alternative Chrome Plugins

The [Video Autoplay Blocker](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/video-autoplay-blocker-by/khhablkjeghmeinlfgecddpgcopnljpm?utm_source=chrome-app-launcher-info-dialog) can be
used as a stopgap until Chrome itself supports better autoplay blocking (early 2018).
